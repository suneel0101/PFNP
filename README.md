# What's Programming? (Sandwich Algorithm)
This should lead us to a working definition of programming.

## Exercise
Get into groups of 3-4 and write instructions for me to make a PB&J sandwich.

# How do websites work
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8c4JZW73cM)

## Questions
Let's walk through all the steps between when you enter a URL in your browser and after the webpage has loaded.

1. What does a domain name service (DNS) do?
2. What language are websites written in?
3. What is a server?

# HTML
1. Download Chrome if you don't have it

## Example websites
0. [GA](https://generalassemb.ly/)
1. [Simple Fractal](http://simplefractal.com/work/)

## Let's create our own website
0. Create a new folder called PFNP
1. In that folder create a new file called `index.html`
2. In that file, enter the code below:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <p>Hello!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Let's add some more elements
0. header text
1. images
2. links

# CSS
What if we want to make it look pretty?

## Let's check out some stylesheets.
Let's view source again and find the stylesheets.

## Prettifying our page
0. Let's add a background color
1. Let's add a different color for links
2. Let's change the h1 font size.
3. Let's put that into its own stylesheet.

## Exercise
Create a file called `about.html` that contains an h1 element with your name and a paragraph or two about you and a link to your linkedin page.

**Bonus**: Add a link to index.html that takes the user to about.html.

# Javascript

What if we want to make a website change in some way when a user interacts with it?

0. What are some examples of user interactions and website responses?
1. Let's add some javascript.

## Useful Javascript libraries
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
- [reactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [emberJS](http://emberjs.com/)
- [angularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

# What about the server? (Backend languages)
## Questions
1. What's a (backend, a.k.a. "server-side") programming language?
2. What should a programming language allow us to do?

## Common backend programming languages
- c
- c++
- PHP
- Java
- Python
- Ruby

## Exercise
0. Get into groups of 3-4,
1. Read [this article](https://medium.com/aws-activate-startup-blog/choosing-the-right-programming-language-for-your-startup-b454be3ed5e2#.ocah02fv8) on choosing the right programming language.

### Questions
0. If you have a large legacy codebase in Java, what language should you use?
1. If you want to do data science, machine learning or anything scientific, which language?
2. If you want to build something very quickly, what language should you use?
3. If you want something that is real-time (like a chat app) and very scalable, what should you use?

Takeaway: choice of language really depends on the situation and skill-set of the team
